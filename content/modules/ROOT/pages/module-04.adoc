== Recording a session

Create a shell as the *rhel* user so that the session can be recorded.
Recall that the *rhel* user’s password is *redhat*.

....
ssh rhel@localhost
....

You will notice that when the `+ssh+` session starts, the *rhel* user
receives the notice message configured in the *tlog* configuration.

[source,bash]
----
rhel@localhost's password: <b>redhat</b>

ATTENTION! Your session is being recorded!

[rhel@somehost ~]$
----

Run some commands in the *rhel* user’s session.

....
ls /tmp
....

....
who
....

....
df -hP
....

....
dnf list installed
....

Now that you have some data in a recorded session, you can log out of
the user’s `+ssh+` session.

....
exit
....
