== Installing software

____
*Note:* For this scenario, we have started installing SQL Server on the
machine. The installation task will take between 2-5 minutes to
complete.
____

First, verify that SQL Server is running on the machine.

[source,bash]
----
systemctl status mssql-server.service --no-pager
----

On the terminal, you should see something like below indicating that the
mssql-server.service is running

<< OUTPUT ABRIDGED >>

Active: active (running) since Monday 2019-07-15 19:24:18 EDT; 3h 59min
left

<< OUTPUT ABRIDGED >>

....

Next, install two rpm packages, __cockpit-session-recording__ and __tlog__ for the web console

```bash
yum -y install cockpit-session-recording tlog
....

<< OUTPUT ABRIDGED >>

Installed: cockpit-session-recording-1-29.el8.noarch tlog-5-1.el8.x86_64

Complete! ```

The first package, *cockpit-session-recording* will add an additional
feature Web Console which you will be using to enable and configure
session recording. The *tlog* package will provide the tools which will
be used to both record and view the recorded terminal sessions.
